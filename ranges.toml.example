# This is an example configuration file for Preflop Trainer.
# To use it, rename this file to `ranges.toml`.

# Welcome to your personal preflop range configuration file.
# This file is where you define the hands you want to play in different situations.
# The format is TOML (https://toml.io), which is designed to be easy to read.

# --- HOW TO DEFINE RANGES ---
#
# A "range" is a collection of poker hands. You can specify a range as a comma-separated
# string of hand notations.
#
# --- HAND NOTATION ---
#
# - Specific pairs: AA, KK, QQ, etc.
# - Suited hands: AKs (Ace-King suited), T9s (Ten-Nine suited), etc.
# - Offsuit hands: AKo (Ace-King offsuit), 76o (Seven-Six offsuit), etc.
#
# --- MIXED STRATEGIES (FREQUENCIES) ---
#
# For situations where you don't want to play a hand 100% of the time, you can
# specify a "mixed strategy" by adding a frequency to the hand notation.
#
# The format is: <Hand>:<Frequency>
#
# For example:
# - "KJs:0.5" means you want to play King-Jack suited 50% of the time.
# - "A5s:0.25" means you want to play Ace-Five suited 25% of the time.
#
# If no frequency is specified, it is assumed to be 1.0 (i.e., play the hand 100% of the time).

# --- SECTION: UNOPENED RAISE RANGES ---
#
# This section defines your opening ranges when the action folds to you in an
# unopened pot. You should define a range for each position.
#
# The positions are:
# - UTG (Under the Gun)
# - MP (Middle Position)
# - CO (Cutoff)
# - BTN (Button)
# - SB (Small Blind)

[unopened_raise.UTG]
# Example range for opening from Under the Gun.
# This is a tight range, consisting of strong hands.
range = "AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,AKs,AQs,AJs,AKo,AQo"

[unopened_raise.MP]
# As your position gets later, you can open a wider range of hands.
range = "AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,99,AKs,AQs,AJs,ATs,KQs,AKo,AQo,AJo"

[unopened_raise.CO]
range = "AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,99,88,AKs,AQs,AJs,ATs,A9s,KQs,KJs,QJs,AKo,AQo,AJo,ATo,KQo"

[unopened_raise.BTN]
# From the button, you can open a very wide range.
range = "AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,99,88,77,66,55,AKs,AQs,AJs,ATs,A9s,A8s,A7s,A6s,A5s,KQs,KJs,KTs,QJs,QTs,JTs,AKo,AQo,AJo,ATo,A9o,KQo,KJo,QJo"

[unopened_raise.SB]
# The Small Blind also opens a wide range, but may play differently than the button
# due to being out of position postflop.
range = "AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,99,88,77,AKs,AQs,AJs,ATs,KQs,KJs,QJs,AKo,AQo,AJo,KQo"


# --- SECTION: BIG BLIND DEFENSE RANGES ---
#
# This section defines how you should react when you are in the Big Blind and
# a single player has raised before you.
#
# You have two primary actions: Call or Re-raise (3-bet).
#
# For each potential opener position, you need to define two ranges:
# - `call_range`: The hands you will call with.
# - `raise_range`: The hands you will re-raise with.

[bb_defense.UTG]
# Defending the Big Blind vs. an Under the Gun open.
# Since UTG's range is tight, your defending range should also be tight.
call_range = "JJ,TT,99,88,AJs,ATs,KQs"
raise_range = "AA,KK,QQ,AKs,AKo"

[bb_defense.MP]
# Defending vs. a Middle Position open.
call_range = "JJ,TT,99,88,77,AQs,AJs,ATs,KQs,KJs"
raise_range = "AA,KK,QQ,AKs,AKo,AQo"

[bb_defense.CO]
call_range = "TT,99,88,77,66,AJs,ATs,A9s,KQs,KJs,KTs,QJs"
raise_range = "AA,KK,QQ,JJ,AKs,AQs,AKo,AQo"

[bb_defense.BTN]
# Defending vs. a Button open.
# The Button's opening range is wide, so you can defend with a much wider range.
call_range = "99,88,77,66,55,ATs,A9s,A8s,KJs,KTs,K9s,QJs,QTs,JTs,T9s,98s,AJo,ATo,KQo,KJo"
raise_range = "AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,AKs,AQs,AJs,AKo,AQo"

[bb_defense.SB]
# Defending vs. a Small Blind open.
# The Small Blind's opening range is also wide.
call_range = "99,88,77,66,55,ATs,A9s,A8s,KJs,KTs,K9s,QJs,QTs,JTs,T9s,98s,AJo,ATo,KQo,KJo"
raise_range = "AA,KK,QQ,JJ,TT,AKs,AQs,AJs,AKo,AQo"

# This section allows you to specify which types of preflop spots you want to practice.
# If this section is omitted, the trainer will randomly generate all possible spot types.
#
# Each entry in the list should be a string representing a specific spot type and position.
#
# Format for Open spots: "Open_<Position>"
#   - Positions: UTG, MP, CO, BTN, SB
#   - Examples: "Open_UTG", "Open_BTN"
#
# Format for Big Blind Defense spots: "BBDefense_<OpenerPosition>"
#   - Opener Positions: UTG, MP, CO, BTN, SB
#   - Examples: "BBDefense_UTG", "BBDefense_BTN"
#
# Example: Practice only opening from the Button and defending the Big Blind vs. a CO open.

# Example: Practice only opening from all positions (and no BB Defense)
# allowed_spot_types = ["Open_UTG", "Open_MP", "Open_CO", "Open_BTN", "Open_SB"]

# Example: Practice only BB Defense vs. all positions (and no opening)
