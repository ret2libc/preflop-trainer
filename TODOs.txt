- [ ] Automatically create a basic ranges.toml file in the user directory (e.g. ~/.config/preflop-trainer/ranges.toml) if one is not provided.
- [ ] Allow users to configure ranges through the GUI when the program starts
- [ ] Support 3bet preflop scenarios
- [ ] Support 4bet preflop scenarios
- [ ] Implement detailed statistics and progress tracking. This could include stats per position, per hand type, etc.
